# Command Config Lib

Lightweight command-based config library.

## Why commands?
Commands are rarely affected by Minecraft updates, making this library compatible with most versions, including snapshots.  
For example, it can be used for:
- Quick in-game config, as it doesn't require opening another GUI.
- Snapshot mod support. GUI config libs mostly focus on big Minecraft releases.
- Multi-version mods. GUI libs are usually version-specific or might be not available for old Minecraft releases.

Note that this library doesn't aim to replace supported GUI config for your mod, but rather provide a robust alternative.
